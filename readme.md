## To promote code

Feature branches are branched off from the `development` branch and then merged back into the `development` branch. Then it merges up to `master`.

```
master ---------------- ---------------- ---------------- ----------------master
development -------------------------------->development /^
   \ ----------> feature branch -/^
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Unit tests are currently written in the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) testing framework. [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) is used as the assertion library and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) is used as the React testing utility.

The tests can be found in the `test` folder.

To run all the tests once, run

    $ npm run test

To run the tests continuously for active development, run

    $ npm run test-dev

To run a specific test file, run

    $ npm run test-file test/unit/TabElement.test.js

### Code Coverage
[Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/) is used for checking code coverage.

To run the code coverage tool and view a quick report, run

    $ npm run coverage

To run the code coverage tool and view a better report, run

    $ npm run coverage-report

This last command will create a folder called `coverage` in the root directory. You can open up `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` in a browser to see more details about what lines of codes have not been tested.
