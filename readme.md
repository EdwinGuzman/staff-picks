## Installation and running locally

### Installation

- Clone repository
- Perform:
    $ npm install

### Quick start

- Get clientId and clientSecret environment variables.
- Perform:
    $ clientId=[clientId] clientSecret=[clientSecret] npm run dev-api-start
- Navigate to http://localhost:3001/books-music-dvds/recommendations/best-books/ya or http://localhost:3001/books-music-dvds/recommendations/best-books/childrens

### Production mode

To run locally in production mode, run:

    $ NODE_ENV=production clientId=[clientId] clientSecret=[clientSecret] npm run dev-api-start

to use the `development` API, or the following to use the `production` API:

    $ NODE_ENV=production clientId=[clientId] clientSecret=[clientSecret] npm run prod-api-start

## To promote code

Feature branches are branched off from the `development` branch and then merged back into the `development` branch. Then it merges up to `master`.

```
master ---------------- ---------------- ---------------- ----------------master
development -------------------------------->development /^
   \ ----------> feature branch -/^
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Unit tests are currently written in the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) testing framework. [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) is used as the assertion library and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) is used as the React testing utility.

The tests can be found in the `test` folder.

To run all the tests once, run

    $ npm run test

To run the tests continuously for active development, run

    $ npm run test-dev

To run a specific test file, run

    $ npm run test-file test/unit/TabElement.test.js

### Code Coverage
[Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/) is used for checking code coverage.

To run the code coverage tool and view a quick report, run

    $ npm run coverage

To run the code coverage tool and view a better report, run

    $ npm run coverage-report

This last command will create a folder called `coverage` in the root directory. You can open up `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` in a browser to see more details about what lines of codes have not been tested.

## AWS Elastic Beanstalk Workflow
### Configuration
All of the AWS Elastic Beanstalk configuration files exist in the `.ebextensions` directory. AWS will run all config files in numerical order based on the prefix `{NUM}_{FILENAME}.config` naming convention.

You must have AWS CLI installed on your machine with the proper AWS Profiles.

> Note: Please use the instance profile of `_cloudwatchable-beanstalk_`. It is configured with all of the permissions necessary for a traditional or Docker-flavored Beanstalk machine that enables logging to CloudWatch.

### Initialization

To initialize the application on AWS via the `aws-cli` run:

```bash
 eb init -i --profile ${your AWS profile}
```
### Creation

Initially we want to create the app on AWS Elastic Beanstalk by using this command:
```bash
eb create ${environment name} \
  --instance_type ${size of instance} (Ex: t2.small) \
  --instance_profile cloudwatchable-beanstalk \
  --scale ${amount of instances} (Ex: 1) \
  --cname ${cname prefix} (Ex: XXX.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com) \
  --vpc.id ${ask for custom vpc_id} \
  --vpc.ec2subnets ${privateSubnetId1,privateSubnetId2} \
  --vpc.elbsubnets ${publicSubnetId1,publicSubnetId2} \
  --vpc.elbpublic (exposes the IP to the public) \
  --keyname ${ssh keyname} (allows the given ssh keyname to have ssh access) \
  --profile ${your AWS profile}
```
> Note: This step is only required upon creation and should executed once.

### Deployment
Once the application has been created via `eb create ...` all subsequent updates and deployments should use the following command:

```bash
eb deploy ${environment name} --profile ${your AWS profile}
```

### KMS Environment Variables
Staff Picks and the API where the data is fetched from are currently deployed on NYPl's AWS instance. In order to fetch data, we are using the `@nypl/nypl-data-api-client` to make requests to the API with an authentication token. You can find the [full documentation here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nypl/nypl-data-api-client), but to be brief, we need a client id, a client secret, and a token url to authenticate.

We currently have a process in NYPL Digital to get said pair of authentication strings. To be more secure in our AWS environment, we are encrypting those variables with AWS KMS. To encrypt the strings, make sure you have the `aws-cli` tool available on your computer and then run:

```
    $ aws kms encrypt --key-id [your-aws-key-id] --plaintext [string-to-encrypt] --output text --query CiphertextBlob --profile [name-of-your-aws-profile]
```

Running this command will output an base64 encrypted string which will be used as the `KMS_ENV` environment variable in AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The app will read the variable, and use the `aws-sdk` library to decrypt it. Once we decrypt it, we can use those values with the `@nypl/nypl-data-api-client` to connect to the API.

As stated above, you will need the client id and secret when running the app locally, but they do not need to be encrypted. The encrypted values will be use in the AWS instances as environment variables and the app will pick those up and use them since the `KMS_ENV` variable will be set to `encrypted` in the Beanstalk instances.

If you would like to use the encrypted variables, you can start the app using:

```
    $ NODE_ENV=production clientId=[encryptedClientId] clientSecret=[encryptedClientSecret] npm run prod-api-start
```
